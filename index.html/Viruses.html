        <h1>What is Computer Virus?</h1>
        <p class="fraud">A computer virus is a kind of malware, or harmful software, that<br>
        replicates itself when it is run by altering and adding code to other programs on 
        the computer. The virus can then infect more applications<br> or systems through the 
        infected files or programs. Although viruses<br> are a particular kind of malware, the 
        term "virus" is frequently used<br> to refer to several kinds of malware.</p>
        <h1 class="defvirus">Key characteristics of computer viruses include:</h1>
        <div class="samples">
          <p><b>1. Self-Replication</b></p>
          <p>Viruses propagate to other programs or systems by replication. They attach themselves<br>
            to papers or executable files in order to accomplish this.</p>
            <br>
          <p><b>2. Destructive Intent</b></p>
          <p>Numerous viruses contain dangerous code or a payload that can damage a computer system.<br>
            This could entail erasing or corrupting files, interfering with system functions, or 
            pilfering confidential data.</p>
            <br>
          <p><b>3. Concealment</b></p>
          <p>Viruses frequently try to conceal themselves in order to evade antivirus software's 
            detection. They could get around security measures in a number of ways.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>4. Actiation Trigger</b></p>
          <p>Most viruses have an activation trigger, which could be a date or a set of 
            circumstances. The virus starts its destructive work as soon as it is activated.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>5. Host Dependence</b></p>
          <p>For their propagation, viruses need host files or applications. They affix themselves
            to <br>authentic files, and the virus is active when those files are run.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>6. Infection Vectors</b></p>
          <p>Viruses can propagate via a number of channels, such as rogue websites, contaminated
            email attachments, removable storage devices, and network weaknesses.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="virusdef">
          Using antivirus software, updating operating systems and software,<br> being cautious when
          opening email attachments and accessing websites, and maintaining good cybersecurity 
          hygiene are all part of protecting against computer viruses. Maintaining regular backups
          of crucial information significantly lessens the damage caused by malware attacks.
        </p>

      <h1>Examples of Computer Viruses</h1>
      <p class="unauthorized">Computer viruses can be of many different kinds, and they are 
        frequently categorized according to their traits, actions, and modes of operation. 
        The following list includes typical computer virus types:</p>
      <div class="introhack">
        <p><b>1. Boot Sector Viruses</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>characteristics: When a system is booted, these viruses can propagate via infecting
          storage devices' master boot records, or MBRs.</li>
          <li>Example: <b>Stoned, Michelangelo.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>2. Worms</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>characteristics: Worms are self-replicating programs that propagate on their own, 
          frequently via email or networks.</li>
          <li>Example: <b>Conficker, ILOVEYOU.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>3. Trojan Horses</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>characteristics: Trojan horses pose as trustworthy software, but within they have 
          malicious code capable of a wide range of destructive operations.</li>
          <li>Example: <b>Back Orifice, SubSeven.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>4. Ransomware</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>characteristics: Ransomware encrypts a user's files and requests payment for the
            decryption key, typically in bitcoin.</li>
            <li>Example: <b>WannaCry, CryptoLocker</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>5. Adware and Spyware</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>characteristics: Spyware surreptitiously gathers data about user activity, whereas 
            adware shows intrusive adverts.</li>
            <li>Example: <b>CoolWebSearch, Zango</b></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="endhack">
        These categories show the various methods that viruses utilize to<br> hack and infect computer 
        systems. To defend against these attacks,<br> users must employ antivirus software, maintain 
        good cybersecurity hygiene, and be watchful.

      <p class="conclusion3">It's crucial to understand that although viruses are one<br> kind of malware, the word "malware" 
        refers to a more<br> general class of malicious software that includes trojan<br> horses, worms, 
        ransomware, spyware, and other<br> dangerous applications.</p>
