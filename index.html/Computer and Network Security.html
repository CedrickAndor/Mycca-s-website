        Computer security is the process of preventing illegal access, attacks, 
        damage, or theft from occurring to computer systems, networks, and data. 
        It is sometimes referred to as cybersecurity or IT security. Ensuring the 
        availability, confidentiality, and integrity of data handled and stored by 
        computer systems is the aim of computer security.

      <h1 class="key">Key Components Of Computer Security</h1>
      <img src="authentication.png" class="uno">
      <p class="first"><strong>Authentication:</strong> Confirming a user's or system's identity to make sure that <br>
           only people with permission can access resources.
      </p>
      <img src="authorization.png" class="autho">
      <p class="second">
        <strong>Authorization:</strong> Granting or denying users access rights and permissions in <br>
        accordance with their positions and duties.
      </p>
      <img src="encryption.png" class="encrypt">
      <p class="third">
        <strong>Encryption:</strong> Securing data by putting it in a format that can only be read by <br>
        those who are authorized and have the right key.
      </p>
      <img src="firewall.png" class="fw">
      <p class="fourth">
        <strong>Firewalls:</strong> Putting in place network security mechanisms to keep an eye on<br>
         and regulate outgoing and incoming network traffic in accordance with <br>
        pre-established security regulations.
      </p>
      <img src="malware.png" class="bug">
      <p class="fifth">
        <strong>Antivirus and Antimalware:</strong> Use software to identify, stop, and get rid of<br>
        malware—malicious software—from computer systems.
      </p>
      <img src="secure.png" class="update">
      <p class="sixth">
        <strong>Security Updates and Patch Management:</strong> Updating operating systems,<br>
        apps, and software on a regular basis to fix security holes <br>
        and known vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Network security involves protecting computer networks and 
          their components from unauthorized access, attacks, and disruptions. 
          It focuses on securing the communication and data transfer between 
          devices within a network, as well as controlling access to network resources.</p>
          <h1 class="key">Key Components Of Network Security</h1>
          <img src="network.png" class="net">
          <p class="first"><strong>Network Encryption:</strong> Implementing encryption protocols to secure data <br>
            transmitted over the network, preventing unauthorized interception.
            <img src="VPN.png" class="private">
          <p class="second"><strong>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</strong> Creating secure, encrypted connections <br>
            over public networks to enable secure remote access or connect<br> 
            geographically dispersed networks.
            <img src="intrusion.png" class="spy">
          <p class="third"><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):</strong> Monitoring network <br>
            traffic for suspicious activities and taking preventive measures to <br>
            block or mitigate potential threats.
          </p>
          <img src="access.png" class="control">
          <p class="fourth"><strong>Network Access Control (NAC):</strong> Enforcing policies that determine which <br>
             devices and users are allowed to access the network, and under <br> what conditions.
          </p>
          <img src="protocol.png" class="sec">
          <p class="fifth"><strong>Security Protocols:</strong> Implementing secure communication protocols <br>
            (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS) to protect data during transmission.

          <img src="nws.png" class="secu">
          <p class="sixth"><strong>Network Security Audits:</strong> Regularly assessing and evaluating the security<br>
             of the network infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.</p>
             <img src="robot.png" class="teach">
          <p class="conclusion">Both computer security and network security <br>
            are crucial components of overall information<br>
            security, working together to create a robust<br>
             defense against a wide range of cyber threats.</p>
