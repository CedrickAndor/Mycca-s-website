    <img url="lastpage.jpg">
    <p>I am Mycca Marasigan a student from Laguna State Polytechnic University <br> San Pablo City Campus under the course of Bachelor of Secondary Education <br> Major in Social Studies
      I am tasked to make a project that will interest the<br> youth about science and technology and my choice of project for this<br> task is to make a website about Network 
      Security because I am passionate<br> about helping everyone to be safe when using the internet. By creating <br>this simple website, it can spark the youth's interest in 
      science and technology<br> by showing how these fields directly impact their online safety. When they see practical examples like how encryption protects their messages,
      or how firewalls shield their devices they may become more curious about the technology <br>behind these tools.</p>
    <h1 class="mission">My Mission</h1>
    <p>Educating individuals and businesses about the evolving cyber security<br> landscape,
      imparting knowledge to make informed decisions and cultivate<br> a culture of security.</p>
