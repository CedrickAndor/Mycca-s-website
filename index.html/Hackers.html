     <h1>What is Hacking?</h1>
     <p class="unauthorized">Unauthorized access, manipulation, or exploitation of computer systems, networks,
      and electronic devices is referred to as "hacking," a general<br>
      word.It involves actions taken by people—often referred to as hackers—who employ their technological know-how to
      circumvent security<br> protocols and obtain unauthorized access to data or resources. Hacking<br>
      can refer to a variety of actions, both malevolent and benign, and it can<br> be divided into several kinds:</p>
     <div class="introhack">
      <p><b>1. Ethical Hackers(White Hat Hackers)</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethical hackers utilize their expertise to find and address security flaws in systems;<br>
        they are frequently hired by companies. Enhancing security and defending against<br>
        malevolent hackers is their aim.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>2. Malicious Hacking(Black Hat Hackers)</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Malevolent cybercriminals partake in unapproved operations with the aim of taking 
        advantage of weaknesses, pilfering confidential information, interfering with services,<br>
        or committing other detrimental acts for their own benefit or malevolent intentions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>3. Hacktivism</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hacking for political or social objectives is known as hacktivism. Hacking is a tactic used<br>
        by activists to further their opinions, voice disapproval, and draw attention to social issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>4. Cracking</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Software that has had copy protection, license limitations, or other security features<br>
        removed without authorization is said to have been "cracked," enabling users to use it<br>
        without the required licenses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>5. Phreaking</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phreaking is the practice of altering or taking advantage of telecommunications networks,
        frequently in order to obtain unauthorized access to phone networks or make free phone<br> calls.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>6. Cyber Espionage</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>corporate or state-sponsored hacking that aims to get trade secrets or intelligence from
        other governments or organizations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>7. Script Kiddie</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Those with limited experience in hacking are known as "script kiddies," and they
        frequently launch attacks using pre-written scripts or tools. They might hack only for
       fun or to show<br> off their skills.</li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     <p class="endhack">It is noteworthy that not every hacking is malevolent, and the term<br>
      "hacker" can refer to someone with a variety of computer technology-related skills. Hacking's ethical or 
      malevolent nature depends on the circumstances surrounding it. Malicious hacking poses 
      major risks to cybersecurity, but ethical hacking is essential to the security of systems<br> 
      and networks.</p>
      <h1>How To Avoid Getting Hacked</h1>
      <p class="defavoid">By taking proactive steps to improve your cybersecurity, you<br>
      can prevent hacking. To reduce your chance of being hacked,<br>
      consider the following general advice:</p>
      <div class="tips">
        <p><b>1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>For your accounts, come up with strong, complicated passwords; do not use the same 
            password on several different platforms. Make use of a mix of special characters, 
            numerals, and capital and lowercase letters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever feasible, turn on 2FA to provide an additional degree of protection. 
            Usually, this entails getting a code via email or your phone, which you have to enter 
            in addition to your password.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>3. Keep Software Updated</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Update your operating system, apps, and antivirus software on a regular basis. 
            Security patches are frequently included in software updates to fix vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>4. Be Cautious With Emails</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email attachments and links should be handled with caution, and unsolicited emails 
            should not be opened. Phishing emails frequently aim to fool recipients into divulging 
            private information.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="endprob">
        <p><b>5. Install and Update Antivirus Software</b></p>

            and<br> keep it updated.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
